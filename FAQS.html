                <p>When it comes to choosing the right dog grooming service, we understand that you might have some questions. 
                So here, we've listend some questions that are usually asked by our potential clients, to hopefully give you some peace of mind.</p>
                
                <h3>1. What services do you offer?</h3>
                <p>Answer: We offer a range of grooming services, including baths, haircuts, nail trims, ear
                    cleaning, teeth brushing, de-shedding treatments, flea and tick treatments, and more. We also
                    have special packages like puppy grooming and deluxe spa options for pampering your pet!</p>
                
                <h3>2. How often should my dog be groomed?</h3>
                <p>Answer: The frequency of grooming depends on your dog's breed, coat type, and lifestyle. Dogs
                    with long or curly coats often need grooming every 4-6 weeks, while short-haired breeds may
                    only need a bath and nail trim every 8-12 weeks. Regular grooming keeps your dog healthy,
                    comfortable, and looking great.</p>
                
                <h3>3. How long does a grooming session take?</h3>
                <p>Answer: A typical grooming session lasts between 2 to 3 hours, depending on the size of your
                    dog, the condition of their coat, and the services selected. For more complex services like de-
                    shedding or specific breed cuts, it might take longer. We always strive to provide efficient
                    service while ensuring your dog feels comfortable and relaxed.</p>
                
                <h3>4. Do I need to make an appointment in advance?</h3>
                <p>Answer: Yes, we recommend booking your appointment in advance, especially during busy
                    times like holidays or weekends. You can schedule appointments easily through our website or
                    by calling us directly.</p>
                
                <h3>5. What if my dog is nervous or anxious about grooming?</h3>
                <p>Answer: We specialize in creating a calm and comfortable environment for all dogs, especially
                    those who are anxious. Our groomers are experienced in handling nervous dogs and use gentle
                    techniques, patience, and plenty of treats to ensure your dog feels safe.</p>
                
                <h3>6. What do I need to do before my dog’s appointment?</h3>
                <p>Answer: Please ensure your dog has had a potty break before arriving for their grooming
                    session. If your dog has any special needs, allergies, or medical conditions, let us know in
                    advance so we can accommodate them.</p>
                
                <h3>7. Do you offer mobile grooming services?</h3>
                <p>Answer: Yes! We offer mobile grooming services where we bring the salon to you. Our fully
                    equipped grooming van provides the same high-quality services at the convenience of your
                    home. Mobile grooming is perfect for dogs who may be stressed by car rides or busy
                    environments.</p>
                
                <h3>8. What products do you use?</h3>
                <p>Answer: We use high-quality, eco-friendly, and natural grooming products that are safe for your
                    dog’s coat and skin. If your dog has sensitive skin or allergies, we offer hypoallergenic and
                    medicated shampoos.</p>
                
                <h3>9. What happens if my dog has fleas or ticks?</h3>
                <p>Answer: If we find fleas or ticks on your dog, we will notify you immediately and recommend a
                    flea and tick treatment during the grooming session. It’s important to address these issues
                    quickly for your dog’s comfort and to prevent spreading them to other pets.</p>
                
                <h3>10. Can I stay with my dog during the grooming session?</h3>
                <p>Answer: For the safety and comfort of both your dog and our groomers, we typically request that
                    pet parents do not stay during the session. Many dogs are calmer and less anxious when their
                    owners are not present. However, feel free to discuss any concerns with us, and we can make
                    accommodations if needed.</p>
                
                <h3>11. Do you groom puppies?</h3>
                <p>Answer: Yes, we offer a special "Puppy’s First Groom" service that introduces young dogs to
                    the grooming process in a gentle and positive way. We take extra care to make their first
                    grooming experience fun and stress-free.</p>
                
                <h3>12. What is your cancellation policy?</h3>
                <p>Answer: We understand that plans change, so we kindly ask for at least 24 hours' notice if you
                    need to cancel or reschedule your appointment. Cancellations made with less than 24 hours’
                    notice may be subject to a fee.</p>
                
                <h3>13. How do I book an appointment?</h3>
                <p>Answer: You can book an appointment directly through our website, call us, or stop by the salon
                    to schedule in person. For mobile grooming, please call to ensure availability in your area.</p>
                
                <h3>14. Do you groom all dog breeds?</h3>
                <p>Answer: Yes, we groom dogs of all breeds, sizes, and coat types. Whether your dog has short
                    hair, long hair, or a double coat, we have experience working with a wide variety of dogs and
                    tailoring grooming services to their specific needs.</p>
                
                <h3>15. What are your payment options?</h3>
                <p>Answer: We accept cash, credit cards, and mobile payment options like Apple Pay and Google
                    Pay. Payments can be made after your dog’s grooming session is completed.</p>
